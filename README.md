# Bootstrap-Portfolio
I struggled with getting the header to format properly when the downsizing. Specifically, I wanted the logo(aka my name) to stretch across the top from side to side once the it hit the 768 px break-point.
I think this project gave me a chance to work with creating classes and moving the styling from the HTML to the css file.
